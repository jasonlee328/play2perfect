"""Unified registry for precise-assembly problem instances.

A `Problem` is the triple `(insertion_object, receptive_object, insert_poses)`
that fully specifies a precise-assembly env configuration. Each sub-package
(`peg`, `fabrica`, `furniture_bench`) registers its problems into
`PROBLEM_REGISTRY` on import; importing `evaluation.problems` triggers all of
them. The registry is then filtered down to the four problems released here
(see `_RELEASED_PROBLEMS` at the bottom of this file).
