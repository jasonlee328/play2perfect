# Play2Perfect

### What Matters in Dexterous Play Pretraining for Precise Assembly?

Official code release for **Play2Perfect**, a 2-stage reinforcement-learning pipeline for
contact-rich robotic assembly.

📄 **Paper:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.26428

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d7e55375-e9e2-4ec0-aa0e-98a5b08bf138

## Overview

Play2Perfect learns precise, contact-rich assembly in two stages:

1. **Play** — pretrain a policy by playing with random objects in free space.
2. **Finetune** — finetune the play policy on a contact-rich assembly task.

This repository provides:

- **Training** code for both stages in Isaac Sim (Isaac Lab).
- **Interactive (viser) evaluation** for four assembly tasks using our released checkpoints.
- A **minimal sim-to-real deployment** reference.

> This release targets **Isaac Sim only**.

## The four assembly tasks

| Task | `problem` key |
|------|----------------|
| Tight insertion (L-peg, 0.5 mm tolerance) | `tight_insertion` |
| Beam assembly — step 1 | `beam_assembly_step1` |
| Beam assembly — step 2 | `beam_assembly_step2` |
| Screwing (furniture leg) | `screwing` |

## Installation

See [docs/isaacsim_installation.md](docs/isaacsim_installation.md) for the full Isaac Sim /
Isaac Lab setup (Python 3.11, `.venv_isaacsim`).

## Quick start

### 1. Download checkpoints

```bash
# Stage-1 play policy + the 4 finetuned assembly policies
python download_checkpoints.py
```

### 2. Interactive evaluation (viser)

```bash
# One problem from a single checkpoint
python evaluation/eval_isaacsim.py \
  --checkpoint-path pretrained_assembly/tight_insertion/model.pth \
  --problem tight_insertion \
  --port 8044

# ...or load all four downloaded policies and switch between them in the GUI
python evaluation/eval_isaacsim.py --policies-dir pretrained_assembly --port 8044
```

Open `http://localhost:8044` in a browser to watch the policy roll out the insertion.

### Offline success-rate evaluation

Headless, batched eval that scores each problem over many parallel envs (one
i.i.d. first-episode trial per env) and prints a success-rate table:

```bash
python evaluation/eval_offline.py --policies-dir pretrained_assembly
```

### 3. Train Stage 1 (play)

```bash
python isaacsimenvs/train.py \
  --task Isaacsimenvs-Play-Direct-v0 \
  --agent rl_games_cfg_entry_point \
  --headless
```

### 4. Finetune Stage 2 (precise assembly)

```bash
python isaacsimenvs/train.py \
  --task Isaacsimenvs-PreciseAssembly-Direct-v0 \
  --agent rl_games_cfg_entry_point \
  --checkpoint pretrained_policy/model.pth \
  env.precise_assembly.problem=tight_insertion \
  --headless
```

## Deployment

See [docs/deployment.md](docs/deployment.md) for the minimal sim-to-real reference.

## Formatting

```bash
./format.sh   # ruff over the Python packages + xmllint over URDFs
```

## Acknowledgements

This codebase builds on excellent prior work:

- [**rl_games**](https://github.com/Denys88/rl_games) — the high-throughput RL library our
  training loop is built on (vendored here).
- [**SAPG**](https://sapg-rl.github.io/) — Split and Aggregate Policy Gradients, the
  large-scale PPO variant we use for training.
- [**SimToolReal**](https://github.com/tylerlum/simtoolreal) — our prior work on
  object-centric tool manipulation, which the Stage-1 "play" pretraining is based on.
